## Description  
The UniVents app is designed to help students and university members discover, register for, and engage with campus events. The app helps users find university events like academic workshops, social gatherings, career fairs, and club meetings.

## Motivation:  
Many students miss out on campus events due to lack of awareness. UniVents makes finding and joining events easy.
